# Python Blackjack Simulator

This Python script simulates a game of blackjack where a player can implement various strategies to play against a dealer. Although rather than using a digital deck, this simulator relies on random number generation to simulate card dealing, this will reduce validity slightly although it should not make enough of a difference to discount the effect of your strategy changes. One Of my first programs.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Implement your desired strategy by modifying the `basic_strategy` function.
4. Adjust the number of games to simulate by changing the `num_games` variable.
5. Run the script and observe the results.

## Strategy Implementation
The `basic_strategy` function defines a simple strategy for playing blackjack. Users can modify this function or create new ones to test different strategies.

## Simulation Results
After running the script, the simulation results will be displayed, showing the number of wins, losses, ties.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Implement card splitting feature
- [ ] Handle card doubling (work in progress)
